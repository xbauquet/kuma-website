### Submitting a patch

Feel free to contribute, we love to receive Pull
Requests! If you have any questions throughout the process, come chat with us first on [Slack](#where-to-seek-for-help)!

When contributing, please follow the guidelines provided in this document. They
will cover topics such as the different Git branches we use, the commit message
format to use or the appropriate code style.

Once you have read them, and you are ready to submit your Pull Request, be sure
to verify a few things:

- Your work was based on the appropriate branch (`master` or `next` vs. `feature/latest`),
  and you are opening your Pull Request against the appropriate one
- Updates that affect the current website and current version of the Kuma documentation 
  should be opened against `master`. Updates that are only going to be effective from the 
  next version of Kuma should be opened against `next` on the same folder as the current
  Kuma version. Prior to any new release we will merge all the PRs against `next` into
  `next`, copy the latest documentation folder into the new release folder, and merge
  against `master`.
- Your commit history is clean: changes are atomic and the git message format
  was respected
- Rebase your work on top of the base branch (seek help online on how to use
  `git rebase`; this is important to ensure your commit history is clean and
   linear)
- The tests are passing: run `yarn test` 

If the above guidelines are respected, your Pull Request will be reviewed by
a maintainer. And if you are asked to update your patch by a reviewer, please do so!

If your Pull Request was accepted and fixes a bug, adds functionality, or
makes it significantly easier to use or understand Kuma's website, congratulations!
You are now an official contributor to Kuma. Get in touch with us to receive
your very own [Contributor T-shirt](#contributor-t-shirt)!

suite.
