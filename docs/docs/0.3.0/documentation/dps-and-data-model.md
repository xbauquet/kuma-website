# DPs and Data Model

When Kuma (`kuma-cp`) runs, it will be waiting for the data-planes to connect and register themselves. In order for a data-plane to successfully run, two things have to happen before being executed:

* There must exist at least one [`Mesh`](../../policies/mesh) in Kuma. By default the system auto-generates a `default` Mesh when the control-plane is run for the first time.
* There must exist a [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity in Kuma **before** the actual data-plane tries to connect to it via `kuma-dp`.

On Universal the [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity must be **manually** created before starting `kuma-dp`, on Kubernetes it is **automatically** created.

## Dataplane Entity

A `Dataplane` entity must be created on the CP `kuma-cp` before a `kuma-dp` instance attempts to connect to the control-plane. On Kubernetes, this operation is fully **automated**. On Universal, it must be executed **manually**.

To understand why the `Dataplane` entity is required, we must take a step back. As we have explained already, Kuma follow a sidecar proxy model for the data-planes, where we have an instance of a data-plane for every instance of our services. Each Service and DP will communicate with each other on the same machine, therefore on `127.0.0.1`.

For example, if we have 6 replicas of a "Redis" service, then we must have one instances of `kuma-dp` running alongside each replica of the service, therefore 6 replicas of `kuma-dp` as well.

::: tip
**Many DPs!** The number of data-planes that we have running can quickly add up, since we have one replica of `kuma-dp` for every replica of every service. That's why it's important for the DP process to be lightweight and consume a few resources, otherwise we would quickly run out of memory, especially on platforms like Kubernetes where multiple services are running on the same underlying host machine. And that's one of the reasons why Kuma leverages Envoy for this task.
:::

When we start a new data-plane in Kuma, **two things** have to happen:

1. The data-plane needs to advertise what service it is responsible for. This is what the `Dataplane` entity does.
2. The data-plane process needs to start accepting incoming and outgoing requests.

These steps are being executed in **two separate** commands:

1. We register the `Dataplane` object via the `kumactl` or HTTP API.
2. Once we have registered the DP, we can start it by running `kuma-dp run`.

::: tip
**Remember**: this is all automated if you are running Kuma on Kubernetes!
:::

The registration of the `Dataplane` includes two main sections that are described below in the [Dataplane Specification](#dataplane-specification):

* `inbound` networking configuration, to configure on what port the DP will listen to accept external requests, specify on what port the service is listening on the same machine (for internal DP <> Service communication), and the [Tags](#tags) that belong to the service. 
* `outbound` networking configuration, to enable the local service to consume other services.

For example, this is how we register a `Dataplane` for an hypotetical Redis service and then start the `kuma-dp` process:

```sh
echo "type: Dataplane
mesh: default
name: redis-1
networking:
  inbound:
  - interface: 127.0.0.1:9000:6379
    tags:
      service: redis" | kumactl apply -f -

kuma-dp run \
  --name=redis-1 \
  --mesh=default \
  --cp-address=http://127.0.0.1:5681 \
  --dataplane-token-file=/tmp/kuma-dp-redis-1-token
```

In the example above, any external client who wants to consume Redis will have to make a request to the DP on port `9000`, which internally will be redirected to the Redis service listening on port `6379`.

Now let's assume that we have another service called "Backend" that internally listens on port `80`, and that makes outgoing requests to the `redis` service:

```sh
echo "type: Dataplane
mesh: default
name: backend-1
networking:
  inbound:
  - interface: 127.0.0.1:8000:80
    tags:
      service: backend
  outbound:
  - interface: :10000
    service: redis" | kumactl apply -f -

kuma-dp run \
  --name=backend-1 \
  --mesh=default \
  --cp-address=http://127.0.0.1:5681 \
  --dataplane-token-file=/tmp/kuma-dp-backend-1-token
```

In order for the `backend` service to successfully consume `redis`, we specify an `outbound` networking section in the `Dataplane` configuration instructing the DP to listen on a new port `10000` and to proxy any outgoing request on port `10000` to the `redis` service. For this to work, we must update our application to consume `redis` on `127.0.0.1:10000`.

::: tip
As mentioned before, this is only required in Universal. In Kubernetes no change to our applications are required thanks to automated transparent proxying.
:::

## Envoy

Since `kuma-dp` is built on top of Envoy, you can enable the [Envoy HTTP API](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin) by starting `kuma-dp` with an additional `KUMA_DATAPLANE_ADMIN_PORT=9901` environment variable (or by setting the `--admin-port=9901` argument). This can be very useful for debugging purposes.

## Tags

A data-plane can have many labels that define its role within your architecture. It is obviously associated to a service, but can also have some other properties that we might want to define. For example, if it runs in a specific world region, or a specific cloud vendor. In Kuma these labels are called `tags` and they are being set in the [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity.

::: tip
There is one special tag, the `service` tag, that must always be set.
:::

Tags are important because can be used later on by any [Policy](../../policies/introduction) that Kuma supports now and in the future. For example, it will be possible to route requests from one region to another assuming there is a `region` tag associated to the data-planes.

## Dataplane Specification

The [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity includes the networking and naming configuration that a data-plane proxy (`kuma-dp`) must have attempting to connect to the control-plane (`kuma-cp`).

In Universal mode we must manually create the [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity before running `kuma-dp`. A [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity can be created with [`kumactl`](#kumactl) or by using the [HTTP API](#http-api). When using [`kumactl`](#kumactl), the entity definition will look like:

```yaml
type: Dataplane
mesh: default
name: web-01
networking:
  inbound:
  - interface: 127.0.0.1:11011:11012
    tags:
      service: backend
  outbound:
  - interface: :33033
    service: redis
```

The `Dataplane` entity includes a few sections:

* `type`: must be `Dataplane`.
* `mesh`: the `Mesh` name we want to associate the data-plane with.
* `name`: this is the name of the data-plane instance, and it must be **unique** for any given `Mesh`. We might have multiple instances of a Service, and therefore multiple instances of the sidecar data-plane proxy. Each one of those sidecar proxy instances must have a unique `name`.
* `networking`: this is the meaty part of the configuration. It determines the behavior of the data-plane on incoming (`inbound`) and outgoing (`outbound`) requests.
  * `inbound`: an array of `interface` objects that determines what services are being exposed via the data-plane. Each `interface` object only supports one port at a time, and you can specify more than one `interface` in case the service opens up more than one port.
    * `interface`: determines the routing logic for incoming requests in the format of `{address}:{dataplane-port}:{service-port}`.
    * `tags`: each data-plane can include any arbitrary number of tags, with the only requirement that `service` is **mandatory** and it identifies the name of service. You can include tags like `version`, `cloud`, `region`, and so on to give more attributes to the `Dataplane` (attributes that can later on be used to apply policies).
  * `outbound`: every outgoing request made by the service must also go thorugh the DP. This object specifies ports that the DP will have to listen to when accepting outgoing requests by the service: 
    * `interface`: the address inclusive of the port that the service needs to consume locally to make a request to the external service
    * `service`: the name of the service associated with the interface.

::: tip
On Kubernetes this whole process is automated via transparent proxying and without changing your application's code. On Universal Kuma doesn't support transparent proxying yet, and the outbound service dependencies have to be manually specified in the [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity. This also means that in Universal **you must update** your codebases to consume those external services on `127.0.0.1` on the port specified in the `outbound` section.
:::

## Kubernetes 

On Kubernetes the data-planes are automatically injected via the `kuma-injector` executable as long as the K8s Namespace includes the following label:

```
kuma.io/sidecar-injection: enabled
```

On Kubernetes the [`Dataplane`](#dataplane-entity) entity is also automatically created for you, and because transparent proxying is being used to communicate between the service and the sidecar proxy, no code changes are required in your applications.
