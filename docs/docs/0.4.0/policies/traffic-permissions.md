# Traffic Permissions

Traffic Permissions allow you to determine security rules for services that consume other services via their [Tags](../documentation/dps-and-data-model/#tags). It is a very useful policy to increase security in the Mesh and compliance in the organization.

You can determine what source services are **allowed** to consume specific destination services. The `service` field is mandatory in both `sources` and `destinations`.

::: warning
In Kuma 0.4.0 the `sources` field only allows for `service` and only `service` will be enforced. This limitation will disappear in the next version of Kuma.
:::

In the example below, the `destinations` includes not only the `service` property, but also an additional `version` tag. You can include any arbitrary tags to any [`Dataplane`](../documentation/dps-and-data-model/#dataplane-specification)

On Universal:

```yaml
type: TrafficPermission
name: permission-1
mesh: default
sources:
  - match:
      service: backend
destinations:
  - match:
      service: redis
      version: '5.0'
```

On Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficPermission
mesh: default
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: permission-1
spec:
  sources:
    - match:
        service: backend
  destinations:
    - match:
        service: redis
        version: '5.0'
```

::: tip
**Match-All**: You can match any value of a tag by using `*`, like `version: '*'`.
