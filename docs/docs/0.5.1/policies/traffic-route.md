# Traffic Route

This policy allows us to configure routing rules for L4 traffic running in our [Mesh](../mesh). This policy provides support for wheighted routing and can be used to implement versioning across our services as well as deployment strategies like blue/green and canary.

### Usage

By default when a service makes a request to another service, Kuma will round robin the request across every data plane proxy belogning to the destination service. It is possible to change this behavior by using this policy, for example:

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab "Kubernetes"
```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficRoute
mesh: default
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: route-example
spec:
  sources:
    - match:
        service: backend.default.svc:80
  destinations:
    - match:
        service: redis.default.svc:6379
  conf:
    - weight: 90
      destination:
        service: redis.default.svc:6379
        version: '1.0'
    - weight: 10
      destination:
        service: redis.default.svc:6379
        version: '2.0'
```

We will apply the configuration with `kubectl apply -f [..]`.

::: tab "Universal"
```yaml
type: TrafficRoute
name: route-example
mesh: default
sources:
  - match:
      service: backend
destinations:
  - match:
      service: redis
conf:
  - weight: 90
    destination:
      service: redis
      version: '1.0'
  - weight: 10
    destination:
      service: redis
      version: '2.0'
```

We will apply the configuration with `kumactl apply -f [..]` or via the [HTTP API](/docs/0.5.1/documentation/http-api).
:::
::::

In this example the `TrafficRoute` policy assigns a positive weight of `90` to the version `1.0` of the `redis` service and a positive weight of `10` to the version `2.0` of the `redis` service. 

:::tip
Note that routing can be applied not just on the automatically provisioned `service` Kuma tag, but on any other tag that we may want to add to our data plane proxies (like `version` in the example above).
:::

Kuma utilizes positive weights in the `TrafficRoute` policy and not percentages, therefore Kuma does not check if the total adds up to 100. If we want to stop sending traffic to a destination service we change the `weight` for that service to 0.
