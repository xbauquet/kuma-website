# Kuma vs XYZ

When Service Mesh first became mainstream around 2017, a few control planes were released by small and large organizations in other to support the first implementations of this new architectural pattern.

These control planes captured a lot of enthusiasm in the early days, but they all lacked pragmatism into creating a viable journey to Service Mesh adoption within existing organizations. These 1st generation solutions are:

* **Greenfield-only**: Hyper-focused on new greenfield applications, without providing a journey to modernize existing workloads running on VM and Bare Metal platforms where the current business runs today, in addition to Kubernetes.
* **Complicated to use**: Service Mesh doesn't have to be complicated, but early implementations were hard to use; they had poor documentation and no clear upgrade path to mitigate breaking changes.
* **Hard to deploy**: Many moving parts, which need to be running optimally at the same time, makes it harder to run and scale a Service Mesh due to the side-effect of higher operational costs.
* **For hobbyists, not organizations**: Lack of understanding of the challenges enterprise organizations face today, with poor support and implementation models.

Kuma exists today to provide a pragmatic journey to implementing Service Mesh for the entire organization and for every team: for those running on modern Kubernetes environments and for those running on more traditional platforms like Virtual Machines and Bare Metal.

* **Universal and Kubernetes-Native**: Platform-agnostic, can run and operate anywhere.
* **Easy to use**: Via automation and a gradual learning curve to Service Mesh policies.
* **Simple to deploy**: In one step, across both Kubernetes and other platforms.
* **Enterprise-Ready**: Pragmatic platform for the Enterprise that delivers business value today.
